# Employee Attrition Analysis
## Problem Statement
Employees are the backbone of any organization. An organization’s performance depends on the quality of employees and how they can retain them. Employee attrition can be for voluntary or involuntary reasons.
The reasons are through natural means like retirement, or it can be through resignation, termination of contract. It costs precious time and money and can result in a loss of staff morale. This could also tarnish a company's reputation.
It is important for any organization to monitor their employee attrition rate and understand why employees are leaving if they want to avoid negative repercussions.

Challenges faced by an Organization due to Employee Attrition:
- Cost in Training new employees
- Loss of experienced employees
- Employee Productivity
- Organization profit

We are using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset for this project. This data set has 1471 rows and 35 columns providing various information on employee’s personal and employment details which will help us in studying the behavioral pattern of the employees and predicting the employee churn rate.

Therefore, Organizations like IBM has to study the behavior of employee attrition to stabilize their work culture, in turn, decrease the loss of employee.

## Questions to answer from data :
- What is the likelihood of an active employee leaving the company?
- What are the key factors of an employee's attrition?
- If there is any gender bias in the organization, which gender has the higher rate of attrition?
- How are the variables correlated?
- How is the distribution of attrition variable?
